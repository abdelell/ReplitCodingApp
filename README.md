There is currently one bug currently in the app(that I know of):
- When going from the home view to a playground the number lines dont appear right away, you need to edit before the line numbers are generated

Since this is just a minimal app, there are a few things that I would improve on: 
- I would add code completion
- Better landscape functionality
- Code "blocks". I.e. Buttons on the side for different code blocks, for example a "function" button would add a pre written function in the code
- Loading view when a user clicks on the run button
- More code syntax highlighting
